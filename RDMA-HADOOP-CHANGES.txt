 NEW FEATURES

     - Based on Apache Hadoop 3.0.0
     - Compliant with Apache Hadoop 3.0.0 APIs and applications
     - High performance design with native InfiniBand and RoCE support at 
       the verbs level for HDFS component
     - Support for RDMA Device Selection
     - Supports deploying Hadoop with Slurm and PBS in different running 
       modes (HHH and HHH-M)
     - Easily configurable for different running modes (HHH and HHH-M) and 
       different protocols (native InfiniBand, RoCE, and IPoIB)
     - On-demand connection setup
     - HDFS over native InfiniBand and RoCE
       - RDMA-based write
       - RDMA-based replication
       - Overlapping in different stages of write and replication
       - Enhanced hybrid HDFS design with in-memory and heterogeneous 
         storage (HHH)
         - Supports two modes of operations
           - HHH (default) with I/O operations over RAM disk, SSD, and HDD
           - HHH-M (in-memory) with I/O operations in-memory
         - Policies to efficiently utilize heterogeneous storage devices 
           (RAM Disk, SSD, and HDD)
           - Greedy and Balanced policies support
           - Automatic policy selection based on available storage types
         - Hybrid replication (in-memory and persistent storage) for HHH 
           default mode
         - Memory replication (in-memory only with lazy persistence) for 
           HHH-M mode

     - Tested with
       - Mellanox InfiniBand adapters (DDR, QDR, FDR, and EDR)
       - RoCE support with Mellanox adapters
       - RAM Disks, SSDs, and HDDs
       - OpenJDK and IBM JDK
